# EECS-484-Project2
Introduction
In Project 2, you will be building a Java application that executes SQL queries against a relational database and places the results in special data structures. We provide you the majority of the structure for the Java application and your job is to fill it with the query text and to process the results of the queries appropriately. This project will give you additional practice with standard SQL query practices in addition to hands-on experience with real-world database application programming.
